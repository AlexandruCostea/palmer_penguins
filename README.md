# Palmer Penguins Classification

This repository contains a collection of classification models for the Palmer Penguins dataset. The project explores both traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks to predict penguin species based on various morphological and environmental features.

## Dataset

The Palmer Penguins dataset consists of observations of penguin species including Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, with features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, island, and sex.
The dataset can be accessed from the following link: https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

## Approach

### Machine Learning Techniques:
- Implemented classifiers using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and decision trees.
- Grid search cross-validation is used for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are utilized to assess model performance.

### Neural Network Models:
- Built neural network models using Keras with different architectures.
- Techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization are employed on different models to enhance model generalization.
- Feature selection is informed by data visualization, including heatmap analysis.

## Results

- The project provides solutions to the classification problem using a combination of traditional machine learning methods and neural networks.
